# DOM Scripting By Example

In this project, we build real useful web application with JavaScript by utilising DOM scripting skills. We are going to program a RSVP app that let user enters name of invited guests and check guests' name off once guests are RSVP'ed. You even code features for filtering and editing guests and removing guests from the list which are the features that are common to many other web applications.
